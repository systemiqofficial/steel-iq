# Steel-IQ High-Performance Optimization Configuration
#
# This configuration enables all available optimizations for maximum performance.
# Note: Advanced solvers (parallel, gasplan) are not yet implemented and will
# fall back to baseline solver with a warning.

optimization:
  lp_solver:
    # Use combined parallel + Gasplan solver (future)
    mode: parallel_gasplan

    # Use all available CPU cores
    workers: auto

    # Enable GPU preprocessing if available
    gpu_preprocessing: true

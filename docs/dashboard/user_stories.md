# Steel Industry Decarbonization Modeling - User Stories

## Data Security & Privacy

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| DS-1 | As a steel company representative, I want to use proprietary data with the simulation model and view the results without having to upload sensitive information to external websites. | High |
| DS-2 | As an IT security officer, I need assurance that our proprietary data remains on our systems and is not uploaded to external servers during simulation processing. | High |

## Data Input & Management

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| DI-1 | As a steel industry professional, I need to upload company data in Excel format that the simulation model can seamlessly process and incorporate into its analysis. | High |
| DI-2 | As a data scientist, I want to easily switch between different economic modeling approaches to compare their results and understand methodological differences in projections. | Medium |
| DI-3 | As an economic strategist, I need to upload our company's confidential production data and have it seamlessly integrate with the model's existing global dataset. | High |

## Installation & Deployment

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| ID-1 | As a corporate steel industry user, I need to install and run a standalone version of the simulation model directly on my company-issued Windows machine to ensure data security and compliance with internal IT policies. | High |

## Parameter Configuration

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| PC-1 | As an industry analyst, I need to adjust carbon pricing scenarios to reflect potential policy changes so I can accurately model their impact on our decarbonization strategy. | Medium |
| PC-2 | As a research scientist, I want to customize technology adoption rates based on our proprietary research so that the simulation reflects our understanding of technology readiness levels. | Medium |
| PC-3 | As an environmental compliance officer, I need to create and save multiple policy scenarios that align with potential upcoming regulations so I can prepare appropriate responses. | Medium |

## Simulation Management

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| SM-1 | As a sustainability manager, I want to create variants of simulation configurations to test sensitivity to specific input parameters without rebuilding the entire scenario. | Medium |
| SM-2 | As a busy consultant working with multiple steel companies, I need to save and categorize different simulation scenarios for different clients so I can quickly retrieve relevant models. | Medium |
| SM-3 | As a user running complex simulations, I want to receive email notifications when long-running simulations complete so I don't need to continuously monitor the application. | Low |

## Results & Analysis

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| RA-1 | As an executive, I need clear visual comparisons between different decarbonization pathways so I can communicate strategic options to our board without technical jargon. | High |
| RA-2 | As a regional operations manager, I want to filter simulation results by geographical area to understand how decarbonization strategies may affect specific facilities. | Medium |
| RA-3 | As a financial analyst, I need to export simulation results in formats compatible with our financial modeling tools to assess capital investment requirements for technology transitions. | Medium |

## Collaboration & Workflow

| ID | User Story | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| CW-1 | As a policy researcher with limited technical background, I want preset scenario templates that I can modify rather than building complex simulations from scratch. | Low |
| CW-2 | As a team lead, I need to share simulation configurations with my colleagues so we can collaborate on refining assumptions without duplicating effort. | Medium |

*Note: Priority levels (High/Medium/Low) are suggested based on the apparent importance of the functionality and could be adjusted based on project requirements and stakeholder feedback.*
